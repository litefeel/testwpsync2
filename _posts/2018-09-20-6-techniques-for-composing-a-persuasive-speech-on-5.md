I after wrote speeches for the governor whose aide advised me: speechwriting is about slinging soundbites with each other. That strategy is known as a recipe for producing neither fantastic speeches nor fine soundbites. When we sat all the way down to go over a speech with the first of all time, President Obama would talk to us: What is the tale we’re hoping to inform?
